This directory contains files used to package wildlifecoind/wildlifecoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile wildlifecoind/wildlifecoin-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

wildlifecoin: URI support
--------------------

wildlifecoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install wildlifecoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your wildlifecoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/wildlifecoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

wildlifecoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
